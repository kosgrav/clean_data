# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
## The original data was modified by:
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
4. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
## Descriptions
### Identifiers
The first two columns are identifiers:
1. Subject: the ID of the subject.
2. Activity: the name of the activity performed by the subject when measurements were taken.

### Measurements
The remaining variables are the calculated means and standard deviations of the sets of data:
The remaining variables are the calculated means and standard deviations of the following sets of data:

* tBodyAccMeanX
* tBodyAccMeanY
